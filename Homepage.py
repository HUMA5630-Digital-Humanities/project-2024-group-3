st.title('About the Project')
st.markdown(" The primary objective of this project is to utilize modern technology to present the classic Chinese text 'The Classic of Mountains and Sea'. Throughout the spring semester of 2024, the project team employed a diverse range of methods, including but not limited to text analysis, spatial mapping, and data analysis, with the ultimate aim of unraveling the enigmatic tales, intricate river and mountain distributions, and various types of mythical creatures depicted in mysterious work. The ultimate goal of the project is to vividly present these ancient Chinese myths using modern technology, thereby showcasing the captivating allure of China's ancient mythology.")
st.title('Findings')
st.markdown("The research findings of this project demonstrate how modern visualization techniques can be used to explore the content of classic works of Chinese literature. ")
st.markdown("The project team began by analyzing the text using various techniques, such as word cloud analysis of high-frequency words, full text annotation, and display. These techniques were visually presented to provide a more intuitive understanding of the text's content. To enhance readers' comprehension of the Classic, different color blocks were implemented in the text to distinguish attributes of words, such as characters, monsters, treasures, and locations.")
st.markdown("Next, the project investigated the geographic descriptions in the Classic through mapping. The research group conducted an in-depth investigation of the complex distribution of rivers and mountains mentioned in the text based on geographical descriptions, gaining insight into the entire ancient mythological world. By drawing maps and comparing them with modern maps, three geographical coordinates were also clarified.")
st.markdown("Finally, the project team categorized the mythical creatures in the classic. This included examining the quantity and classification of creatures and using pie charts to illustrate the distribution of creature numbers in each chapter and the proportion of each creature type. Additionally, the page provides original texts and translations of relevant mythical creatures to help readers gain a more vivid comprehension of them. This offers a fascinating and distinctive approach to exploring the text's content. Overall, these findings provide a fresh perspective on classic works of literature through the lens of modern visualization techniques, and make a valuable contribution to the study of Chinese mythology and literature.")
